I used Windows 10 OS and completed this assignment in VSCode.

I compiled the code in MSYS2 MINGW-64 using the Makefile provided byt the prof on Discord.

main.cpp contains the main function for mathLib2D.cpp and has all the basic testing for it, which tests
 all the Point2D and Vec2D methods using print statements to output results.

 Paint program supports all functionality specified in Assignment1.pdf. 
 
 When clicking +/-, PointSize gets incrementted/decremented by 5 units each time so that effect is more visible. 
 So resizing of points allows changing the pointSize between 5,10,15,20,25. PointSize starts of at 15.

Try Pressing the space-bar for a surprise bonus functionality :)
